    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Gabriela Botura, I have a degree in Management
      Information Systems and Marketing from Ohio University. I have 5
      years of professional experience in consulting with my skills ranging
      from back-end development and data analysis to process improvement.
      <p>My passion for the arts sparked at a young age when I realized how
        much I can express myself through different types of creative outlets.
        I became classicaly trained on the piano, I pursued painting classes, I perfected
        my geometric drawings, and smoothed my calligraphing.</p>
      <p>Coming from a technical professional background, it is hard to showcase my
        creative mindset to produce a beautiful product for my clients. My goal
        is to transition to UI/UX design to incorporate two of the things I know best:
        technical knowledge and creativity. I want to use my technical skills to <strong>design
        with the front end in mind</strong> while tapping into my creative mind to create
        <strong>smart, functional, and visually appealing designs </strong>for my clients needs.
