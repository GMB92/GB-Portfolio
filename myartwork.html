    <p>Employer wanted to <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">create a unique agile management tool
      that does not exist in the market.</span></strong> The team had to brainstorm a solution
      to create an application from scratch by creating the marketing brand,
      web design, and making it unique from competitors. I led the UI/UX portion of
      this project and was <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">responsible for all design related decisions and deliverables.</span></strong>
      I collaborated with the product manager, engineers, and Subject Matter Experts to
      to design this agile management tool, keeping the end user in mind throughout
      the process.<strong><span style="color:#3c3262;"> The software was implemented and introduced to the company </strong></span> and will
      be branched out to clients as well. Below is an example of an "edit" function.</p>

    <p>A local nonprofit wanted to <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">rebrand, modernize current website,
      and launch a new design</span></strong> to the organization in a tight timeframe.
      The organization had very limited technical expertise and availability to discuss requirements. As the lead UX/UI designer, I
      tackled this <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">end-to-end redesign product by focusing on applying strategies from
      Human-Centered Design methodology.</span></strong> I was responsible for the accuracy and completion
      of all design-related work deliverables which included: conducting and
      synthesizing user research, building the wireframes, conducting usability testing,
      and building a prototype for the user interface. The client was thrilled
      about the work product and <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">held an event to showcase the new design to the entire
      organization.</span></strong> Below is an example of the home screen that was shown at the event.</p>

    <p>Once I discovered my passion for UI/UX design and committed my career to it,
      I realized <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">I needed to create a portfolio.</span></strong> I did not want to use a template
      but wanted to <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">challenge myself in designing, coding, and deploying the website.</span></strong>
      I quickly <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">learned HTML/CSS and some JavaScript to to build a website from scratch.</span></strong> I seeked professional opinions from experts to
      validate that my portfolio can stand out from others. <strong><span style="color:#3c3262;">The outcome is...well you're looking at it!</span></strong> Everything
      you see on this website I created. I'm constantly learning and using new information on making this website better. Checkout the sneak peek below of my code!</p>

  <p><strong>Solution:</strong>Weekly iterations to confirm design accurately conveys the data</p>
  <p><strong>Results:</strong>The infographic was published to Deloitte's website</p>
