    <p>Employer wanted to <style="color:#d8a7d8;">create a unique agile management tool
      that does not exist in the market.</strong> The team had to brainstorm a solution
      to create an application from scratch by creating the marketing brand,
      web design, and making it unique from competitors. I led the UI/UX portion of
      this project and was <strong>responsible for all design related decisions and deliverables.</strong>
      I collaborated with the product manager, engineers, and Subject Matter Experts to
      to design this agile management tool, keeping the end user in mind throughout
      the process.<strong> The software was implemented and introduced to the company </strong> and will
      be branched out to clients as well. Below is an example of an "edit" function.</p>

    <p><strong>Problem:</strong>Local nonprofit wanted to rebrand and modernize current website</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong>Short deadline and the client had limited technical expertise</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong>Use-Centered Design to conduct interviews, market research, and build wireframes, screens designs and clickable prototypes<br>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong>The client invited the team to an event to reveal the new website design to the organization</p>
